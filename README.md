# MessageEnco
Message encoder decoder using char int values

The executable jar file is ready to be run on any machine that has the Java runtime environment installed. A user settable password is used to encode any message using a rotation (ROT xx) like algorithm. The resulting "encrypted" file is nothing but a list of numbers. The decoder function can also be used to "decrpyt" any input messages.
